Alright! After starting this blog up 3, no 4...no 5...maybe 6? times, lets just say I have spent a long time messing with Octopress and trying to decide how I wanted to start blogging. I went from Octopress to trying to write my own framework, to looking at Wordpress, back to Octopress...realized my first mistake was not sticking with Octopress, then deciding I didn’t like the "Classic" theme, so I spent a week breaking the layout and colors, spent another week trying to roll back my broken changes. Then I finally just threw my hands up and re-cloned it. So here I am.

There was probably no traffic on the first 15 versions of this blog so lets do the intro again. Hi! My name is Joe Liberi and I am a Network Engineer living and working in the greatest state in our country, New Jersey. (If you have a problem with that leave a comment down below and I will promptly delete it with as much fury as my pointer finger can dish out). Along with making the Internet work I work with Linux environments daily, fix broken Exchange environments and just generally try to make thing run smoothly for every aspect of my clients businesses. The first couple posts are going to be short and sweet, they will outline some Cisco ASA tips and tricks, maybe converting NAT rules form pre 8.3 to post 8.3, maybe some access lists maybe even a SourceFIRE installation and configuration! Who knows! Not me, that’s for sure.
